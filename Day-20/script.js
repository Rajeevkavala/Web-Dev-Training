/**
 * This script demonstrates the usage and features of arrays and objects in JavaScript.
 *
 * Arrays:
 * Arrays are a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable.
 * They are a special type of object in JavaScript.
 *
 * Example:
 * let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
 *
 * Arrays can hold any type of data, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.
 *
 * Common array methods include:
 * - push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
 * - pop(): Removes the last element from an array.
 * - shift(): Removes the first element from an array.
 * - unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
 * - forEach(): Executes a provided function once for each array element.
 * - map(): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
 * - filter(): Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
 * - reduce(): Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
 *
 * Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0.

// how to access an obj


// let obj = {1:"Rajeev",2:"Rahul",3:"Dhana",4:"Goutham"}

/** Objects:
 * Objects are a collection of properties, where each property is defined as a key-value pair.
 * They are used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
 *
 * Example:
 * let obj = {1: "Rajeev", 2: "Rahul", 3: "Dhana", 4: "Goutham"};
 *
 * Objects can be created using the object literal syntax or the Object constructor.
 *
 * Common object operations include:
 * - Accessing properties using dot notation or bracket notation.
 * - Adding, modifying, or deleting properties.
 * - Iterating over properties using loops or Object methods.
